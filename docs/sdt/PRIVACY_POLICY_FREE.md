# Privacy Policy for "Since Days To"  
Effective date: 2025-01-01Contact: support@oppahansi.de

1) Overview

"Since Days To" is primarily an offline-first app that runs on-device for core functionality.
This version includes advertisements provided by Google AdMob to support free access to the app.
Core app data (e.g., talent builds, notes) is stored locally and does not require an internet connection unless ads are being displayed or you explicitly export data.
No user accounts or cloud services are required for core functionality.

2) Data Collection and Sharing

App Data: We do not collect, transmit, or share personal data for the core functionality of the app (e.g., talent builds, notes, dates, optional photos). All such data is stored locally on your device.
Google AdMob: This version uses Google AdMob to serve advertisements. Google AdMob may collect and process certain data to provide personalized or non-personalized ads, including:
Device information (e.g., device type, operating system, unique device identifiers).
IP address and approximate location (e.g., country or region) derived from your IP address.
Usage data related to ad interactions (e.g., ad impressions, clicks).
Google AdMob’s data practices are governed by Google’s Privacy Policy.


We do not use additional third-party services or SDKs for analytics, telemetry, crash reporting, or tracking beyond Google AdMob for ads.
You can opt out of personalized ads through your device settings (e.g., Android’s “Opt out of Ads Personalization” or iOS’s “Limit Ad Tracking”).

3) On-Device Data and Storage

Data you enter (e.g., talent builds, notes, dates, optional photos) is stored locally in an on-device database.
The database is not transmitted to any server by the app unless you explicitly export it.
Exports and imports are user-initiated file operations (e.g., via iOS Files / Android Downloads).
Backups are plain files; handle and store them securely according to your preferences.

4) Permissions and Platform Features

iOS Document Picker / Android File Access: Used to export/import your local database.
Network Permissions: Required for Google AdMob to load and display ads and, optionally, to load external character builds if you choose to do so.
No Additional Permissions: The app does not require access to contacts, camera, microphone, or other sensitive features unless explicitly needed for user-initiated actions (e.g., adding optional photos to notes).

5) Security

Core app data remains on your device. The app does not add encryption at rest to the local database or backups; rely on your device’s OS-level protections and your own storage practices.
When exporting, you control the destination and retention of backup files.
Ad-related data handled by Google AdMob is subject to Google’s security practices as outlined in Google’s Privacy Policy.

6) Data Retention and Deletion

App Data: You control all core app data. Delete items in-app, delete backups from your storage, or uninstall the app to remove app data from your device. We hold no server-side copies of your core app data.
Ad-Related Data: Google AdMob may retain certain data (e.g., ad interaction data) as per Google’s Privacy Policy. You can manage ad-related data through your Google account settings or device-level ad preferences.

7) Children’s Privacy

The app is not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
Google AdMob complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and does not serve personalized ads to users identified as children.

8) Regional Notices

EU/EEA (GDPR): Core app data is not processed or transferred by us; it remains on your device unless you export it. Google AdMob may process personal data for ads, acting as a data controller. You can manage your consent for personalized ads via device settings. For more details, see Google’s Privacy Policy.
California (CCPA/CPRA): We do not “sell” or “share” your core app data as defined by law. Google AdMob may share ad-related data as described in their policy, and you can opt out of personalized ads to limit data sharing.

9) Apple App Privacy (App Store)

Data Collected: None by the core app. Google AdMob may collect data for ads (see Section 2).
Tracking: Ad-related tracking by Google AdMob may occur unless you opt out of personalized ads via device settings.

10) Google Play Data Safety

Data Collected: No core app data is collected by us. Google AdMob may collect device identifiers, IP address, and ad interaction data.
Data Shared with Third Parties: Ad-related data may be shared by Google AdMob as per their Privacy Policy.
Data Deletion: You can delete core app data and backups at any time. Ad-related data is managed through Google’s settings.

11) Changes to this Policy  

We may update this policy as needed. Material changes will be reflected in this file with an updated effective date.
